    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "1. The revenue per session per user is `0.07` units of currency (e.g $, Yen etc).\n",
    "2. Most users who buy more have had lower sessions on the website. Indicating we have gaukers who will buy less but browse more. Maybe it hints at some inequality divide.\n",
    "\n",

    "We can segment the customers who spend more for less session count vs those with higher session count based on demographics, the quantity of purchased goods, the frequency of purchases and reviews or customer support tickets."

    "### Approach\n",
    "1. We use this equation to find customer lifetime value<br>\n",
    "   CLTV = Average Order Value × Purchase Frequency × Average Customer Lifespan\n",
    "2. We use Pareto charts to find out how CLTV changes with customers. We sort the customers based on their CLTV and plot it in descending order. We split customers into `30 groups/quantiles` and plot a bar for each.\n",
    "3. We futher segment the customers by `New`, `Loyal`, `One-Time` and `Churned` and plot Pareto charts for each segment's CLTV. We define the most important segment `Loyal Customers` as those that have bought before and after a fixed date a recent period.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights\n",
    "1. It turns out that the CLTV of each customer is `4866.794` units of currency (e.g $, Yen etc).\n",
    "2. The highest quantile `1/30` of total customers contribute to `1/2` of total revenue/spending. Then our pareto's cummulative sum crossed the `80%` total revenue/spending at the top `11th` quantile or `~1/3` of total customers.<br>\n",
    "This aligns with the `80/20` rule that `20%` customers contribute to the `80%` revenue/spending. In our case it was `70/30`.\n",
    "3. The other segments also follow `80/20` rule, however their spending is miniscual compared to loyal customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Analysis\n",
    "1. We can futher analyse the Average Order Value we found out while calcualting CLTV.\n",
    "2. We can segment customers by demographics, order quantity and review or customer support tickets."

    "We should take note that Social Media Marketing is only slightly better performance than the regular old channels, it is not very performant.\n",
    "3. The estimates for revenue generation vary, but both agree that Search Engine Marketing derives the highest Revenue. Other forms include In-Store Promotion and Radio Advertisement.<br>\n",

    "        3. After puchase they dont leave the site, but go to other pages, maybe finding similar things.\n",
    "        4. It is odd, that most searches don't lead to product or page view, instead they leave or just add things to wishlist. Are users treating the site as a social media feed, browsing for entertainment? Maybe.\n",
    "        5. By putting items in wishlist, the people seem to feel the need to browse from other sites or maybe from local store, before finalizing purchase, so they leave the site.\n",

    "        1. Nothing out of ordinary, except that we dont have customers browing alot of pages. What do I mean? Well, the customers should have spent alof of time on a lot of products if we were a big ecommerce company, but data shows that while we get alot of customers we dont get alot that browse alot. Maximum visits of pages/product views is near `15`, `2`on median, we have failed to hook the audience to the site.\n",

    "### Future Analysis\n",
    "1. We need to make sure that sessions are being maintained or are they being ended by some technical fault. Although in reality this is a normal behaviour\n",
    "2. We noticed people stay on the site after purchasing products, does this mean they are more likely to spend more after spending before?\n",
    "3. We have not done any indepth analysis, we need to measure time of sessions and measure performance based on that.\n",
    "4. We need interactivity measures e.g how much time was spend on a page and how it related to funnel or drop off."
